## Conditional Probability
- StackAdapt: If you flip a coin twice and the first time it was head, what is the probability that the second time is also head?
- StackAdapt: Toss a fair coin twice, given at least one of them is a head, what is the probability of both of them are heads?

## Counting
- StackAdapt: A submarine starts starts at a depth of 30 meters below the surface. Each round, you roll a fair six-sided die (values 1-6), and the submarine moves upward by the number rolled (in meters). You have exactly 7 rounds to move. What is the probability that after 7 rolls, the submarine reaches exactly the surface (depth 0)?


## Probability Distributions
- StackAdapt: How to calculate the probability of k wins after n games if the probability of winning at each game is given?
- Bolt: Given $X \sim N(0, 1), Y \sim N(0, 1)$, solve $P(Y > 3X)$.

## Markov Chains
- StackAdapt: Each bacteria can (1) die with probability of 0.4, (2) stay as it is with probability of 0.1, (3) split into two with probability of 0.5. What is the probability of all bacteria dying out at generation N based on recursive reasoning?
